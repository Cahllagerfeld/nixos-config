# NixOS Configuration

This Repo stores the current configurations for my NixOS.
I'm very new to the whole topic so its quite close to the generated `configuration.nix`.

After cloning the repo the scripts can be run to setup the machine.
`apply-system` applies the system-wide configuration, while `apply-users` uses `home-manager` to apply the user-specific configurations.

Because I'm quite new to it, some best-practices aren't used yet. If there are any things that could be improved feel free to raise an issue for this. I'm quite keen on getting deeper into Nix.
